**Purpose:**<br>
This is a very simple project, all this is is a comment section, similar to the ones found under videos on Youtube.com, or under photos on Facebook.com.

**Overview:**<br>
This project has a very simple and straightforward interface.  When the application loads, the user is presented with a location where they can enter a comment to add to the current thread.  If the user wishes, they can also add a username to that comment, but this is optional.  The username is not set to carry over, and needs to be entered each time a comment is added if the user wishes to have a username associated with that comment.
